Description: fetchR is an R package for calculating fetch (exposure). The
    current convention for calculating fetch is to calculate the distances from the
    marine location to the shoreline (up to a maximum distance) for every 10 degrees
    on the compass rose. These fetch vectors are then used to calculate the average
    fetch (or wind exposure) for the coastal site. The distance and orientation
    calculations are done on the NZ Transverse Mercator 2000 map projection.
