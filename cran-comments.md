## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed the redundant "in R" in the package title
* Surrounded package names in the DESCRIPTION file with single quotes
* Included a reference to the InVEST coastal vulnerability model and clarified
  the reasons for which wind fetch is useful and likely calculated.

## Test environments
* local ubuntu install 16.04, R 3.4.0
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci; devel and release)
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

### NOTEs
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
    Maintainer: 'Blake Seers <blake.seers@gmail.com>'
    
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  KML (20:61)
  fetchR (17:65)

This is the correct email address and the possibly mis-spelled words in the 
DESCRIPTION are spelled correctly.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies.
